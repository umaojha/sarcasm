## Dataset Description

This repository includes the full sarcasm dataset created by Swami et al.,
along with the complete Hindi and English translations prepared by the authors.
The dataset also contains additional preprocessing and normalization
information used in the experiments.

Below is a detailed description of each column in the dataset:

### **Columns**

| Column Name      | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Unnamed: 0**   | Index column automatically generated during CSV export. Not used in the model. |
| **text**         | Original text/tweet from the Swami sarcasm dataset. This is the raw, unprocessed sample. |
| **label**        | Original label from the dataset (e.g., sarcastic vs. non-sarcastic). |
| **clean_tweet**  | Preprocessed and normalized version created by the authors. Includes text cleaning, emoji handling, spelling correction, normalization of transliterated Hinglish terms, and removal of noise. |
| **English**      | Author-generated English translation of each sample. Added to support multilingual preprocessing and cross-lingual comparison. |
| **hindi**        | Full Hindi translation created by the authors. This helps demonstrate translation quality, multilingual feature processing, and use of Hindi semantics in the study. |
| **sentiment**    | Additional sentiment annotation or polarity value assigned by the authors (if applicable for the experiment). |

### **Purpose of Including These Columns**

These columns are included for the following reasons:

- To provide full transparency of the preprocessing pipeline.
- To show the relationship between original text, cleaned text, and translated versions.
- To support reviewer requests for code + sample data + transformation examples.
- To demonstrate how normalization, translation, and augmentation were performed.
- To help anyone reproduce or understand the logic used in the experiments.

### **Notes**

- Only the original `text` and `label` columns come from the Swami et al. dataset.  
- All other columns (`clean_tweet`, `English`, `hindi`, `sentiment`) were prepared by the authors as part of the research workflow.
- The dataset is shared here solely for review and reproducibility, as requested by the reviewer.
